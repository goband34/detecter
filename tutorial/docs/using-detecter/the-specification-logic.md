# The Specification Logic sHML
---

## Overview

For the sake of simplicity, the script `hello_prop.hml` used in our hello world example specifies a sHML property that every system necessarily violates, namely, the formula `#!shml ff` that denotes falsity.
We now look at the full sHML grammar that enables us to express more interesting and useful properties *about programs* (not traces).
Specifications in sHML---also called *formulae*---are interpreted over the *states* of transition models of programs we wish to analyse.
sHML is a syntactic subset of the more expressive Hennessy-Milner Logic with recursion, and is used to specify [safety properties](getting-started.md#safety-properties).
Recall safety properties state that "something bad should never happen".
sHML formulae are generated from the following grammar:

```{ .shml .annotate }
φ ∈ sHML ::=  ff  |  tt             (1)
       |  X                         (2)
       |  max(X. φ)                 (3) 
       |  and([α₁]φ₁, ..., [αₙ]φₙ)   (4)
```

1. Formulae `#!shml ff` and `#!shml tt` denote *falsity* and *truth* respectively,

2. `#!shml X` is a *logical variable*,

3. The *maximal fix-point* construct specifies *recursion* via the logical variable `#!shml X` and *binds* the free occurrences of `#!shml X` in the sub-formula `#!shml φ`, and,

4. `#!shml and(...)` is a sequence of comma-separated *conjunctions* where each conjunct is a sub-formula `#!shml φᵢ` *guarded* by the universal modal operator `#!shml [αᵢ]` (also called a *necessity*).

To handle reasoning over program event data, the modal operator is equipped with *symbolic actions* `#!shml α` of the form `#!shml P when C`, where `#!shml P` is an *event pattern* and `#!shml C`, a *decidable Boolean constraint*.
Patterns correspond to events that the program under analysis exhibits. 
These patterns contain *data variables* that are instantiated with values learnt at runtime from *matched* events.
Pattern variables *bind* the free variables in constraints `#!shml C`, and this binding scope *extends* to the continuation formula `#!shml φ`.
Symbolic action patterns follow the pattern-matching syntax of Erlang and Elixir, where atoms are matched directly, and the 'don't care' pattern `_` matches any data value.
Central to the conjuncted necessities construct, `#!shml and([α₁]φ₁, ..., [αₙ]φₙ)`, is the constraint that at any one point in time, *at most one* conjunct `#!shml [αᵢ]φᵢ` may be satisfied.
This enables detectEr to [synthesise](synthesising-analysers.md) deterministic analyser code [Refs:Antoins,IAN,TutPaper].

We say that a program (or a program state) satisfies the formula `#!shml [P when C]φ` *whenever* it exhibits an event that matches pattern `#!shml P`, fulfils the constraint `#!shml C`, *and* the ensuing program behaviour then satisfies `#!shml φ`. 
When the constraint is `#!shml true`, the expression `#!shml when C` may be omitted for readability.

## Pattern and constraint expressions

detectEr supports five event patterns describing the lifecycle of processes.
A `fork` action is exhibited by a process when it spawns a new child process; its dual, `init`, is exhibited by the corresponding child upon initialisation.
Process `exit` actions signal termination, while `send` and `recv` describe process interaction.

| Program event  | Event pattern                             | Pattern variable    | Description                                                         |
| :-----------: | :----------------------------------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fork`        | `P₁` **-->** `P₂`, `Mod`:`Fun`(`Args`)     | `P₁`                | PID of the parent process spawning `P₂`                             |
|               |                                            | `P₂`                | PID of the child process spawned by `P₁`                            |

| `init`        | `P₁` **<--** `P₂`, `Mod`:`Fun`(`Args`)     | `P₁`                | PID of the parent process spawning `P₂`                             |
|               |                                            | `P₂`                | PID of the child process spawned by `P₁`                            |
|               |                                            | `Mod`:`Fun`(`Args`) | Function signature consisting of the module, function and arguments |
| `exit`        | `P₁` __**__ `Reason`                       | `P₁`                | PID of the terminated process                                       |
|               |                                            | `Reason`            | Termination reason                                                  |
| `send`        | `P₁` **:** `P₂` **!** `Msg`                | `P₁`                | PID of the process issuing the message                              |
|               |                                            | `P₂`                | PID of the recipient process                                        |
|               |                                            | `Msg`               | Message payload                                                     |
| `recv`        | `P₂` **?** `Msg`                           | `P₂`                | PID of the recipient process                                        |
|               |                                            | `Msg`               | Message payload                                                     |

The variables `P₁` and `P₂` in event patterns must be a port ID or PID, whereas `Reason` and `Msg` may be any [Erlang data type](http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-6.0/doc/reference_manual/data_types.html), *i.e.*, one of atom, Boolean, integer, float, string, bit string, reference, fun, port ID, PID, tuple, map, and list.
`Mod` and `Fun` must be atoms, and `Args`, an arbitrary list comprised of the aforementioned data types.

!!! note "Pattern matching"
    Our current detectEr syntax does not yet implement full Erlang pattern matching, including $, map, record and bit string expressions; these will be added in future releases of the tool.
    Note that these data values can still be used in patterns, so long as the pattern matching expression does not *unwrap* the individual data components of these values.
    For instance, the pattern `Var = Map` is acceptable whereas `#{K := V} = Map` is not; similarly, `Var = List` may be used but not `[$d, $a | _] = List`.
    
Constraint definitions on pattern variables used by detectEr correspond to Erlang [guard sequences](https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html#guard-sequences) consisting of [guard expressions](https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/expressions.html#guard-sequences).
The set of valid Erlang guards supported by detectEr are the following:

* Variables.
* Values, *i.e.*, atom, Boolean, integer, float, string, bit string, reference, fun, port ID, PID, tuple, map, and list.
* Expressions constructing atoms, integer, floats, lists, and tuples.

## A simple example

Let us try to specify a safety requirement on the behaviour of our [calculator program](getting-started.md#calculator-program).
The sHML formula with symbolic action `#!shml Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot} when Tot < 0` describes the property requiring that "the program state does *not* exhibit a send event whose payload consists of `#!erlang {bye, Tot}` with a negative total:

```shml
and([Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot} when Tot < 0]ff)
```

Recall that the universal modality states that, for any program event satisfying the symbolic action `#!shml P when C` in `#!shml [P when C]φ`, the ensuing program behaviour must then satisfy the continuation formula `#!shml φ`.
However, *no* program state can satisfy the continuation `#!shml ff`! 
This means that the formula `#!shml and([Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot} when Tot < 0]ff)` can only be satisfied when  our calculator program does not exhibit the event described by the symbolic action `#!erlang Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot} when Tot < 0`.

Suppose our server with PID `#!erlang <0.10.0>` exhibits the `send` event `#!erlang <0.10.0>:<0.16.0> ! {bye, -1}` in response to a request issued by a client with PID `#!erlang <0.16.0>`.
It matches pattern `#!shml Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot}`, instantiating the variables `#!erlang Srv = <0.10.0>`, `#!erlang Clt = <0.16.0>`, and `#!erlang Tot = -1`.
The constraint `#!erlang when Tot < 0` is also satisfied by `#!erlang Tot`, leading to a violation, *i.e.*, `#!shml ff`.
For a different `send` event `#!erlang <0.10.0>:<0.16.0> ! {bye, 1}`, the symbolic action in the modality `#!shml [Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot} when Tot < 0]` is not satisfied, and consequently, `#!shml and([Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot} when Tot < 0]ff)` is not violated.
Analogously, the `exit` event `#!erlang <0.10.0> ** killed` does not lead to a violation of the formula since the pattern `#!shml Srv:Clt ! {bye, Tot}` fails to match the event shape.

!!! note "Cheat sheet"
    The formula `#!shml [α]ff` means that the program must not perform the symbolic action `#!shml α`.

We next learn how the [safety properties P~1~, P~2~, P~3~, and P~4~](getting-started.md#safety-properties) stated informally can be expressed in sHML.
